->Tkinter Variable Demo
    This project demonstrates the use of Tkinter variables (such as StringVar) to dynamically update GUI elements in Python.
    The program uses an Object-Oriented Approach to create a window with an Entry field, Label, and Button â€” all linked to the same StringVar so changes in one widget are instantly reflected in others.

->Features
    Tkinter & ttk widgets for a modern GUI look
    Dynamic updates using StringVar
    Centralized window creation with auto-centering
    Custom window icon using PhotoImage
    Error handling with logging
    Organized OOP structure

->How it works
    The window is created and centered on the screen.
    A StringVar is initialized with the default value "Welcome".
    An Entry and a Label share the same StringVar, so typing in the Entry updates the Label in real-time.
    A Button prints the current value of the StringVar to the console.
